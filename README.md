# MyFunctions

# Desription

This is one of my first project at the first year in MIPT. 

This repository is my library with implementation of the main basic string functions from the _string.h_ library. 
In particular, there are: _strcmp_, _puts_, _atoi_, _itoa_, and _fgets_. It also contains documentation in doxygen.
